# Intelligent-Design
Small game made as console application. It is kind of a puzzle game based on Connway's Game of Life. You can change which squares contain life and the goal is to get to a certain board state with the least amount of edits. More a programming exercise and proof of concept than a serious game, with only one very basic level.
